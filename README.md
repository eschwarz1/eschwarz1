Step 1: Create a new repository for your profile README
In the upper-right corner of any page, select , then click New repository.

Screenshot of a GitHub dropdown menu showing options to create new items. The menu item "New repository" is outlined in dark orange.
Under "Repository name", type a repository name that matches your GitHub username. For example, if your username is "octocat", the repository name must be "octocat."

Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your repository. For example, "My personal repository."

Select Public.

Select Initialize this repository with a README.

Click Create repository.

Step 2: Edit the README.md file
Click the  next to your profile README.

Screenshot of @octocat's profile README. A pencil icon is outlined in dark orange.
In the "Edit" view, you'll see some pre-populated text to get you started. On line 1, delete the text that says ### Hi there and type # About me.

In Markdown syntax, ### renders the plain text as a small ("third-level") heading, while ## or # renders a second- and first-level heading respectively.
Toggle to "Preview" to see how the plain text now renders. You should see the new text displayed as a much larger heading.

Toggle back to the "Edit" view.

Delete line 3 and line 16.

This HTML syntax (e.g. <!--) is keeping the other lines hidden when you toggle to "Preview".
Complete some of the prompts on lines 8 to 15, and delete any lines you don't want. For example, add your interests, skills, hobbies, or a fun fact about yourself.

Now, toggle to "Preview". You should see your completed prompts render as a bulleted list.

Toggle back to "Edit" and remove any other lines of text that you don't want displayed on your profile.

Keep customizing and editing your profile README.

When you're happy with how your profile README looks in "Preview", and you're ready to publish it, click Commit changes...
In the open dialog box, simply click again Commit changes.
Navigate back to your profile page. You will see your new profile README displayed on your profile.
